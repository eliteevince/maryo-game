1) Place Mario.jar / Mario_v1.5.jar file(s) in this folder
2) run Mario_GamePad_Patch.jar 
3) Click Patch... wait for few seconds
4) Now the Game Files (Mario.jar / Mario_v1.5.jar) are Patched but you will always need files

On Windows :
		jinput-dx8.dll 
		jinput-dx8_64.dll
		jinput-raw.dll
		jinput-raw_64.dll
		jinput-wintab.dll

On Linux  :
		libjinput-linux64.so
		libjinput-linux.so

On Mac OS :
		libjinput-osx.jnilib

Folder not needed after patch : joystick , net , SandBoxNes and SandBoxSNes and File Mario_GamePad_Patch.jar

now you can run game as Usual but befor running game connect gamepad because the game detects gamepad only on startup .

press gamepad start twice on main menu .... otherwise it will stay in paused mode

Warning : After Patching the Game will run on Java 1.5 and above (not on 1.4 and lower ... so beek original Mario.jar)
